I've spent around 8-9 hours to build this complete application. 
If I had more time, I would have added the functionality for users to edit and delete items from favourite's list, and I would've made UI/UX a lot better.

React hooks is a very good feature that is introduced to react very recently, it has made creating and managing non state functions very easy.

Performance issues can be track down using tools from chrome developer tools, we can audit websites in both desktop and mobile and get all the stats of the website performance. We can see how much time does the website is taking to download all the content.
I've done this in almost all the projects I've worked on.

There are a lot of ways to handle website performance. We can save data in cache to reduce network calls and static downloads, although not all the data can be stored in the cache, especially something that updates frequently. We should serve the website and all the static files through CDN. We should use very limited number of third party libraries.
