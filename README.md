## url-shortener

This web app generates URL shortener and tracks basic user info like city, country, IP, device, OS and browser. 

# Technologies Used
ReactJs, NodeJS, MongoDB, Express, Webpack, Heroku

# Application architecture
This application maintains a URL address to a shortcode map. When the user visits the shortened link, it fetches the desired URL and redirects the user to it. And also stores their basic information on a mongo document.

# Future additions
If I had more time, I would have added an authentication layer to it. So every publisher can have separate dashboard and will have easy and secure access to their URLs and visitors' details.
